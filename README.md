### CI/CD Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated versioning, building and publishing:

1. **Release Workflow** - Single workflow that handles everything
   - Trigger manually from GitHub Actions tab
   - Choose version type: patch, minor, or major
   - The workflow will:
     - Bump the version in package.json
     - Build the project
     - Commit changes and create a tag
     - Publish to npm

To release a new version:
1. Go to Actions → Release → Run workflow
2. Select version type (patch/minor/major)
3. Click "Run workflow"

Note: Requires `NPM_TOKEN` secret to be set in repository settings.
